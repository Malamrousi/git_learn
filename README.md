## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers manage changes to source code over time. It allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously, track changes, and revert to previous versions if needed.

## Installing Git

To get started with Git, you'll first need to install it on your machine. Follow the instructions for your operating system:

- **Windows**: [Download Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and follow the installation wizard.
- **macOS**: Git is pre-installed on macOS. If you don't have it, install it via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/): `brew install git`
- **Linux**: Use the package manager for your distribution. For example, on Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install git`

## Basic Git Commands

### git init

`git init` initializes a new Git repository in your project directory. Run this command when you start a new project:

```bash
git init
